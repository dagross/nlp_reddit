chances getting reelected secondly there are lot places that are not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that this actually fairly common practice finally answer whether not the new government would recognized other nations the answer most likely that some would recognize the new government and others probably wouldn who recognizes the new regime and who doesn probably depends lot what this new government looks like its anything like constitutional democracy there good chance some most the west recognizes them and some less democratic governments probably will too the new regime were be authoritarian one its little more in the air its not good look openly support totalitarian government even you are one but some almost

wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing blog posts and hosting instagram lives calling myself hamhock and talking about how you can prepare your brain for better performance and especially started demanding money for what was doing that

horizons love hear about people engaging with theory and applying or challenging or discussing this needs happen more and one big way that the academic community can support this to make research and information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain

starting war really hurts your chances getting reelected secondly there are lot places that are not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that

probably wouldn who recognizes the new regime and who doesn probably depends lot what this new government looks like its anything like constitutional democracy there good chance some most the west recognizes them and some less democratic governments probably will too the new regime were be authoritarian one its little more in the air its not good look openly support totalitarian government even

completely agree with all that you have say about the ivory castle problem with academia and the general issues with access gatekeeping and white standards dialogue and totally the vast majority us will not experts given field and nobody can an expert all them also love these questions and personally don have the answers don think any one person institution does that there one line that you cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing blog posts and hosting instagram lives calling myself hamhock and talking about how you can prepare your brain for better performance and especially started demanding money for what was doing that would imo wrong fully support and encourage people read the literature get there and find what interests you what resonates with your experience and what stretches your understanding and expands your horizons love hear about people engaging with theory and applying or challenging or discussing this needs happen more and one big way that the academic community can support this to make research and information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain

starting war really hurts your chances getting reelected secondly there are lot places that are not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that

completely agree with all that you have say about the ivory castle problem with academia and the general issues with access gatekeeping and white standards dialogue and totally the vast majority us will not experts given field and nobody can an expert all them also love these questions and personally don have the answers don think any one person institution does that there one line that you cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing

information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain

not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very

also love these questions and personally don have the answers don think any one person institution does that there one line that you cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful

started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain language summaries articles wouldn hurt and

flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that this actually fairly common practice finally answer whether not the new government would recognized other nations the answer most likely that some would recognize the new government and others probably wouldn who recognizes the new regime and who doesn probably depends lot what this new government looks like its anything like constitutional democracy there good chance some most the west recognizes them and some less democratic governments probably will too the new regime were be authoritarian one its little more in the air its not good look openly support totalitarian government even you are one but some almost certainly still would the west general and the in specific doesn exactly have spotless track record this area but paper you would see less acceptance this kind revolution

cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing

information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain

starting war really hurts your chances getting reelected secondly there are lot places that are not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that

probably wouldn who recognizes the new regime and who doesn probably depends lot what this new government looks like its anything like constitutional democracy there good chance some most the west recognizes them and some less democratic governments probably will too the new regime were be authoritarian one its little more in the air its not good look openly support totalitarian government even

cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing blog posts and hosting instagram lives calling myself hamhock and talking about how you can prepare your brain for better performance and especially started demanding money for what was doing that

horizons love hear about people engaging with theory and applying or challenging or discussing this needs happen more and one big way that the academic community can support this to make research and information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain

that would depend lot where and how said revolution were happen and what the new regime looked like opposed the old one general most countries don tend get involved directly civil wars anymore you probably wouldn see modern example the french actively sending their military fight the british the american revolution for few reasons firstly there are lot more democracies the world now and starting war really hurts your chances getting reelected secondly there are lot places that are not really democracies but like pretend they are and getting involved this way raises whole bunch red flags around the world and might get you sanctioned which bad for business thirdly war very expensive and doesn actually contribute scientific advancements the way people think does if your going directly intervene you need really good reason your lot more likely see other countries contribute revolution non military way such selling giving weapons one side non military aid something like that

probably wouldn who recognizes the new regime and who doesn probably depends lot what this new government looks like its anything like constitutional democracy there good chance some most the west recognizes them and some less democratic governments probably will too the new regime were be authoritarian one its little more in the air its not good look openly support totalitarian government even

completely agree with all that you have say about the ivory castle problem with academia and the general issues with access gatekeeping and white standards dialogue and totally the vast majority us will not experts given field and nobody can an expert all them also love these questions and personally don have the answers don think any one person institution does that there one line that you cross and are suddenly qualified do however think people need be honest about their experience and understanding and the position from which they speaking the primary reason mentioned my comment that so strongly believe that there real need for more public discussions and lay explanations social science research and theory exactly because there are these issues access that you bring here sociology anthropology psychology none these are too complicated for the average person grasp and engage with apply their own lives and communities the problem think lies lack dialogue between the research community and the public to more pointed the problem lies academia tendency not as supportive people who into applied public facing roles and its tendency toward increasingly inaccessible language that not true across the board and is changing many places but academic change always glacial best and still have long way go better support public discourse glad you brought crt actually because that great example long and complex history inter disciplinary primarily bipoc writers thinkers and academics who work more recent academics also primarily bipoc have brought together and distilled into something that accessible those outside the fields that contributed the current theory their work drawing together and distilling complex history research and thought has provided lens that now almost anyone can access and through which can now look our world and experiences and develop more nuanced understanding what see honestly such great example some pretty wide ranging social theory work made approachable and easily understandable the issue was getting and which have with emily and kiona specifically not all that they are trying engage with these things issue that they are trying teach these things present their understanding the correct understanding and expecting profit from that is irresponsible additional big issue that they also refuse hear criticism be corrected when they are wrong which just anti everything think useful and important about research discourse and public education for example kiona phd in public health iirc that great would awesome she found ways share that knowledge with the public especially she did in way that sparked discussion and brought together range thought and expertise that field engage with those us who don know anything about the field and are curious however much think that sounds great would unethical for with academic background do the same thing no way have the training be teaching people about public health psychology philosophy physical therapy chemistry computer science million other things and would extra unethical for to use the credentials that do have make people think that was expert those other fields can share personal experience things that ve found useful interesting things ve read that thought were interesting even have conversations about say sports psychology but started making infographics and writing blog posts and hosting instagram lives calling myself hamhock and talking about how you can prepare your brain for better performance and especially started demanding money for what was doing that would imo wrong fully support and encourage people read the literature get there and find what interests you what resonates with your experience and what stretches your understanding and expands your horizons love hear about people engaging with theory and applying or challenging or discussing this needs happen more and one big way that the academic community can support this to make research and information more freely available don even get started pay play journals and academic paywalls another to better support public facing publicly engaged researchers and teachers also requiring plain language summaries articles wouldn hurt and recognizing books with non academics target audiences equally important publications what don support people misrepresenting their experience make

when most us could run around barefoot roads and stones etc kids what changed the modern day shoe and less activity excercise causing less circulation mobility and strength for our legs and feet for some could too much activity for what their tissues can handle atheletes people just starting excercise again now with these factors and the fact are heavier we get older what happens injury now lets digress and talk about any other injury you to physio for what will they work circulation mobility and strength eventually leading resistance excercises then progress slow and progressive loading all support structures around the injury this leads healing building tissue tolerance capacity but must done remember this slow and progressively while not reinjuring why won this work for and for those you that pooh pooh strengthening and mobility saying you have tried all that and didn work well can you single legged heel raises with back pack full books   sets   reps then you might have argument otherwise shut people won admit they are lazy got pf from letting myself leading sedentary lifestyle outside work weighed   and all the fatso that say they need lose healed pf strengthening while still being overweight strengthening stimulates healing which leads increased tissue tolerance and capacity bear daily loads which sounds pretty smart but reality true this what have learnt far
